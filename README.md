## 🗃️ Database Design

**Key Entities & Fields:**

1. **Users**
   - `id`, `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`, `date_joined`
   - A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

2. **Properties**
   - `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`
   - Each property belongs to one user and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

3. **Bookings**
   - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `total_price`
   - A booking belongs to both a property and a user.

4. **Reviews**
   - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`
   - Each review is linked to a property and a user.

5. **Payments**
   - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`, `transaction_date`
   - Each payment is tied to one booking.

**Entity Relationships:**
- **User → Property:** One-to-Many  
- **User → Booking:** One-to-Many  
- **Property → Booking:** One-to-Many  
- **Property → Review:** One-to-Many  
- **Booking → Payment:** One-to-One

## ⚙️ Feature Breakdown

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 👤 **User Management** | Handles user registration, authentication (JWT), and profiles. |
| 🏡 **Property Management** | Hosts can add, update, and remove property listings. |
| 📅 **Booking System** | Users can book available properties and view booking history. |
| ⭐ **Review System** | Guests can leave ratings and comments on properties. |
| 💳 **Payment Integration** | Securely processes payments and stores transaction records. |
| 🔍 **Search & Filter** | Filters listings based on location, price, and date. |
| 🛠️ **Admin Dashboard** | Admin monitors users, properties, payments, and reviews. |

## 🔐 API Security

| **Measure** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Authentication & Authorization** | Implemented using JWT to secure endpoints. |
| **Input Validation** | Prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Limits excessive API calls to protect against brute force attacks. |
| **HTTPS & Secure Headers** | Encrypts data in transit and adds protective headers. |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Grants access based on user roles (Admin, Host, Guest). |

**Why Security Matters:**
- Protects sensitive user and payment data.  
- Prevents unauthorized access and data breaches.  
- Ensures trust, reliability, and system integrity.
